# Step 1: Filtering data without Augmentation
### GHCN-Daily Data Processing

This project processes GHCN-Daily weather data using Hadoop MapReduce, focusing on filtering records from 1974 to 2024 for specific elements (TMAX, TMIN, PRCP) and outputting them without augmentation.

### Components

- **Mapper (`GHCNMapper.java`)**: Filters records by year and element.
- **Reducer (`GHCNReducer.java`)**: Passes filtered records directly to output.
- **Driver (`GHCNDataProcessor.java`)**: Configures and runs the MapReduce job.

### Running the Job

Compile the Java classes into a JAR and run the MapReduce job with:

```sh
hadoop jar /opt/hadoop-3.2.1/share/hadoop/mapreduce/DataFiltering-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar GHCNDataProcessor user/root/input/weather output/filter
```

- `<input_path>`: HDFS path to GHCN-Daily data.
- `<output_path>`: HDFS path for job output (must not exist prior).

### output is stored
  ```sh hadoop fs -cat output/*```
### Output Format

The output is a CSV with columns: StationID, Date, ElementType, Value.


### Step 2: Preprocessing GHCN Stations Data 

We need state name, location for each of previous station id's , that we can able to grab only from ghcnd_stations.txt and ghcnd-states.txt so this helper job removes unwanted records from ghncd-stations.txt. This is helpful for future augmentation

### Components

- **Mapper (`GhcndStationMapper.java`)**: Processes station data to replace state codes with state names for USA and Canada, and formats records. Parse logic is different according to country because for mexico we dont have statecode
- **Reducer (`GhcndStationReducer.java`)**: Aggregates processed data.
- **Driver (`GhcndStationDriver.java`)**: Manages job execution.

### Execution

To execute, compile into a JAR and run with:

```sh
hadoop jar GhcndStationsFilter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.GhcndStationDriver metadatafiles/ghcnd-stations.txt meta metadatafiles/ghcnd-states.txt
```

- `metadata/ghcnd-stations.txt`: Is the file that we have to parse.
- `meta`: Destination for preprocessed data.
- `ghcnd-states.txt` is used for converting state code to actual state name

We will rename the file generated by this map reduce job
```sh
 hadoop fs -mv meta/part-r-00000 metadatafiles/ghcnd_stations_updated.csv
```

### Output

The output is formatted as CSV with columns: StationID, StateName, LocationName, Country, ensuring data is ready for detailed analysis with enhanced geographic context.
