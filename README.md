## Project: Analyzing Climate Trends in North America with Cloud Computing

**Learning Outcomes:**

* **Master Hadoop and Hive:** Gain hands-on experience with these big data tools for large-scale data analysis.
* **Data Wrangling Fundamentals:** Learn crucial skills like data cleaning and preparation.
* **Advanced Data Analysis:** Perform temperature and precipitation analysis, identify extreme weather events, and assess long-term climate trends.
* **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving:** Make data-driven decisions and troubleshoot challenges.
* **Collaboration and Communication:** Work effectively in teams and present complex findings clearly.

**Overview of each Tasks:**

1. **Data Quality (MapReduce):** Clean and prepare the data for further analysis. This involves filtering, handling missing values, and addressing outliers in temperature and precipitation data.
2. **Temperature Analysis (MapReduce):** Develop MapReduce jobs to analyze temperature data for specific locations and time periods, providing average minimum, maximum, and average temperatures at different aggregation units (year, month, day).
3. **Extreme Weather Events (Hive):** Use HiveQL to identify and analyze extreme weather events like heatwaves and cold spells based on user-defined criteria. Calculate frequency and intensity of these events across different locations.
4. **Precipitation Analysis (MapReduce):** Analyze precipitation data for specific locations and time periods, calculating total precipitation at different aggregation units. Additionally, identify periods of heavy rainfall or drought based on defined thresholds.
5. **Climate Change Trends (MapReduce or Hive):** Analyze long-term temperature and precipitation trends across different regions. This involves aggregating data by country/state and month, calculating relevant statistics, and identifying patterns and variations over the 50-year period.

**Problem 1: Data Preparation and Quality Assurance**

**Objective:** Prepare the GHCNd data for analysis, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

**Tasks:**

1. **Environment Setup and Data Acquisition:**

    * **Step 1.1:** Install and configure Hadoop on your local machine or a cloud platform (e.g., AWS EMR, Azure HDInsight).
    * **Step 1.2:** Install and configure Hive on top of your Hadoop environment.
    * **Step 1.3:** Set up your development environment with necessary libraries/tools for scripting (e.g., Python with PySpark) and data manipulation (e.g., Pandas).
    * **Step 1.4:** Download the GHCNd dataset for North America from the NOAA website.
    * **Step 1.5:** Upload the downloaded dataset to the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for distributed processing.
    * **Step 1.6:** Create a Hive table to represent the GHCNd data structure, allowing you to query the data using HiveQL.

2. **Data Filtering and Augmentation:**

    * **Step 2.1 (Choose Option A or B):**
        **Option A (MapReduce):**
            * Develop a MapReduce job to filter the data based on the desired date range (1974-2024).
            * Implement similar logic as described in the previous version for filtering based on location (US, Canada, Mexico).
        **Option B (HiveQL):**
            * Use HiveQL queries to achieve both date and location filtering in a single step. Leverage `WHERE` clause conditions for date filtering and filter by specific country names or codes for location.
    * **Step 2.2 (HiveQL):** Load station metadata (containing location details) into a separate Hive table.
    * **Step 2.3 (HiveQL):** Use a `JOIN` query to merge the filtered weather data with the station metadata table based on a common identifier (e.g., station ID). This enriches the weather data with additional location information.

3. **Handling Missing or Incomplete Data:**

    * **Step 3.1 (Choose Option A or B):**
        **Option A (MapReduce):**
            * Write a MapReduce job to calculate the number of missing data points for each station across the entire dataset.
            * Implement another MapReduce job to identify and exclude stations exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., more than 10 consecutive days of missing data).
        **Option B (HiveQL):**
            * Utilize HiveQL functions like `COUNT` and conditional expressions to identify stations with excessive missing data points.
    * **Step 3.2 (Choose Option A or B):**
        **Option A (MapReduce):**
            * Develop a MapReduce job to impute missing temperature and precipitation data using average values calculated from surrounding data points.
        **Option B (HiveQL):**
            * Use HiveQL's `AVG` function and window functions like `LEAD`/`LAG` to calculate average values for missing data points based on surrounding data points.
    * **Step 3.3 (HiveQL):** Update the existing Hive table with the imputed values to replace missing data.

4. **Outlier Detection and Correction:**

    * **Step 4.1 (Choose Option A or B):**
        **Option A (MapReduce):**
            * Develop a MapReduce job to calculate statistical measures like mean and standard deviation for both temperature and precipitation data across the entire dataset.
            * Identify outliers exceeding a specific threshold (e.g., 3 standard deviations away from the mean) and replace them with median values.
        **Option B (HiveQL):**
            * Utilize HiveQL window functions like `AVG` and `STDDEV` to calculate statistics. 
            * Use conditional expressions and comparison operators to identify outliers based on the calculated mean and standard deviation.
            * Update the table with median values retrieved using appropriate window functions (e.g., `MEDIAN`).

5. **Final Data Quality Assurance and Compilation:**

    * **Step 5.1 (HiveQL):** Perform final checks using HiveQL queries to validate data transformations and ensure data quality.
    * **Step 5.2 (HiveQL):** Use `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` to compile the final, cleaned dataset ready for further analysis.
