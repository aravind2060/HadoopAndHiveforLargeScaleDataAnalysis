# HadoopAndHiveforLargeScaleDataAnalysis


### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, participants will have achieved a multifaceted understanding of data analysis at scale. Here are the key learning outcomes:

1. **Mastery of Hadoop and Hive**: You'll gain hands-on experience in deploying and utilizing these powerful tools for managing and analyzing big data, providing a solid foundation in big data analytics.
2. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Learn the critical steps of filtering, augmenting, and cleansing data to ensure accuracy and reliability, an essential skill in any data scientist's toolkit.
3. **Advanced Data Analysis**: Through temperature and precipitation analysis, identifying extreme weather events, and assessing long-term climate change trends, you'll develop advanced analytical skills.
4. **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**: The project challenges you to make decisions based on incomplete data, requiring creativity and critical thinking to fill in the gaps and draw meaningful conclusions.
5. **Collaboration and Communication**: Working in groups, you'll enhance your ability to collaborate effectively, a key skill in any professional setting. Preparing a comprehensive report and presentation will also hone your communication skills, allowing you to convey complex information clearly and compellingly.

**Overview of each Tasks:**

1. **Data Quality (MapReduce):** Clean and prepare the data for further analysis. This involves filtering, handling missing values, and addressing outliers in temperature and precipitation data.
2. **Temperature Analysis (MapReduce):** Develop MapReduce jobs to analyze temperature data for specific locations and time periods, providing average minimum, maximum, and average temperatures at different aggregation units (year, month, day).
3. **Extreme Weather Events (Hive):** Use HiveQL to identify and analyze extreme weather events like heatwaves and cold spells based on user-defined criteria. Calculate frequency and intensity of these events across different locations.
4. **Precipitation Analysis (MapReduce):** Analyze precipitation data for specific locations and time periods, calculating total precipitation at different aggregation units. Additionally, identify periods of heavy rainfall or drought based on defined thresholds.
5. **Climate Change Trends (MapReduce or Hive):** Analyze long-term temperature and precipitation trends across different regions. This involves aggregating data by country/state and month, calculating relevant statistics, and identifying patterns and variations over the 50-year period.


# Problem 1: Data Preparation and Quality Assurance

The objective is to prepare the GHCNd dataset for analysis, ensuring data quality and integrity. We will leverage both MapReduce for custom data processing tasks and HiveQL for tasks suited to SQL-like queries.

## Task 1: Environment Setup and Data Acquisition and Storage

### Using MapReduce and Hive
- **Step 1**: Set up Hadoop and Hive environments.
- **Step 2**: Download the GHCNd dataset and upload it to HDFS.
- **Step 3**: Create a Hive table to represent the GHCNd data for easy querying.

## Task 2: Data Filtering and Augmentation

### Using MapReduce
- **Goal**: Filter data by date range (1974-2024) and geographic location (United States, Canada, Mexico).
- **Steps**:
  1. Write a MapReduce job in your chosen language to select records within the specified date range.
  2. Further refine output to include only target geographic locations.

### Using HiveQL
- **Goal**: Augment weather data with station metadata.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load station metadata into a separate Hive table.
  2. Use a `JOIN` query to merge weather data with station metadata based on station IDs.

## Task 3: Handling Missing or Incomplete Data

### Using MapReduce
- **Goal**: Identify and exclude stations with significant missing data.
- **Steps**:
  1. Develop a MapReduce job to count missing data points for each station.
  2. Exclude stations with more than 10 consecutive days of missing data.

### Using HiveQL
- **Goal**: Impute missing temperature and precipitation data.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use `AVG` and `LEAD`/`LAG` functions in HiveQL to calculate average values for missing data points.
  2. Apply these average values to impute missing data.

## Task 4: Outlier Detection and Correction

### Using MapReduce
- **Goal**: Detect and correct outliers in temperature and precipitation data.
- **Steps**:
  1. Implement a MapReduce job to calculate statistical metrics (mean, standard deviation) for temperature and precipitation.
  2. Identify outliers as data points beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean and replace them with median values.

### Using HiveQL
- **Goal**: Simplify outlier detection with SQL-like queries.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use HiveQL to identify outliers using the `NTILE` function to group data into percentiles.
  2. Update outlier values to median values within the same percentile group.

## Task 5: Final Data Quality Assurance and Compilation

### Using Hive
- **Goal**: Ensure data quality and compile the final dataset.
- **Steps**:
  1. Perform a final review using HiveQL queries to validate data transformations.
  2. Use `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` to compile the final, cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
